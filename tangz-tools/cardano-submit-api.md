**RULES OF THE ROAD**

All services by WildTangz are governed by the full [Wild Tangz T\&C](https://www.wildtangz.com/terms-and-conditions). These are just node-specific rules of the road. Please refer there for any definitive rules.

Welcome to your custom node! About to live the fast life on Cardano. Here are some policies you should know about:

1. We monitor and collect all logs about where your traffic is originating from. In addition, your specific node is geofenced for both security and compliance. **If you plan to travel please let us know in advance (at least 48 hours)**
2. You are using the Cardano network as your own actor, we store none of your keys and do not interfere with your transactions. We cannot guarantee execution on the network, and you run the full risk of transactions failing/being rejected. **You are responsible for all transactions submitted through/from your node.** Please ensure your node is running ahead of a big mint or event you are interested in.
3. _BE A GOOD PERSON_: The most important part of this is to be a good faith actor. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the node at any point, regardless of your holdings.

To configure your custom node, please use a wallet like Eternl or Nami (Vespr currently is not supported) and go into the "Advanced Settings". There, you should find a custom node setting, which will ask you for a path to your custom node. Your custom node will be found at:&#x20;

:information\_source:_Custom Node URL will be here_

**DO NOT SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH OTHERS AS THEY WILL BE ABLE TO USE YOUR NODE**

If you have any questions, please use your Discord support ticket as a resource and be sure to tag me. We hope you enjoy using our node service!!
