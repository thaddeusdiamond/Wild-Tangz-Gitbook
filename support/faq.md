**Wen Mint?**&#x20;

Our public mint started on 6/15 at 5pm UTC (1pm ET/10am PST) and _SOLD OUT ON THE MORNING OF SATURDAY JULY 9TH_. We will never mint any more Wild Tangz Series 1. _DO NOT GET SCAMMED._ The mint price was 30₳ and the policy was set to expire on November 17, 2022 UTC (slot 77081375).

**How Many?**&#x20;

Our Series 1 launch will contain only 4,444 unique Wild Tangz. Several of those will be custom 1-of-1s drawn for team members and early supporters.

**Can I Sell Them?**&#x20;

Secondary listings can be placed or purchased on \[JPG.store]\([https://www.jpg.store/collection/wildtangz](https://www.jpg.store/collection/wildtangz)) or \[epoch.art]\([https://epoch.art/asset-collection/33568ad11f93b3e79ae8dee5ad928ded72adcea719e92108caf1521b](https://epoch.art/asset-collection/33568ad11f93b3e79ae8dee5ad928ded72adcea719e92108caf1521b)) where our project is verified. Please be aware that the prices of NFTs are extremely volatile and fluctuations in the prices of other NFTs and impact the price of your Wild Tangz both positively and negatively.  Given the volatility, NFTs such as Wild Tangz should not be considered an investment. You assume all risks in that connection.&#x20;

**Where Minting Service**

Day 1 Utility includes an \[easy minting UI for 1-of-1 NFTs]\([https://www.wildtangz.com/mint-machine](https://www.wildtangz.com/mint-machine)) our hodlers want to create. All of our code is open-sourced via \[iOddestHumanDad’s Github account]\([https://github.com/thaddeusdiamond](https://github.com/thaddeusdiamond)), but the hosted versions can be found in the header under “Tangz Toolz”.&#x20;

**Where Discord? Where Twitter?**&#x20;

Come engage with us on our \[Twitter]\([https://twitter.com/wildtangz](https://twitter.com/wildtangz)) and Discord ([**http://discord.gg/wildtangz**](http://discord.gg/wildtangz)) sites. We love feedback!&#x20;

**How IRL?**&#x20;

We have a detailed roadmap of future artwork, open-source projects and IRL experiences (aka merch) that we are planning to develop using the proceeds from the mint. To read more, visit our Discord server and become a Tangz hodler to get a vote on the roadmap!&#x20;

**In all honesty, what else do I need to know?**

We’ll be as transparent as we can and always strive to build an open, positive community! We are not having any special deals on mint price for anyone. We will mint \~1% of all Tangz for giveaways and team members.\
