# FAQ

**Is There Utility?**

We have a lot of great utility in this project exclusively for Wild Tangz holders! Be sure to verify your wallet in ⁠[the Discord](https://discord.gg/wildtangz) to start with. If you hold Series 2 NFTs (see below for mint details), you can use the NEW APP at [https://wildtangz.com/](https://wildtangz.com/) and [on iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wild-tangz/id1635181620) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wildtangz.cardano.nft\&hl=en\_US\&gl=US).

**Wen Mint?**

SERIES 2 MINT IS LIVE! Check out [https://wildtangz.com/mint](https://wildtangz.com/mint) to upgrade your Series 1 NFT or to pull a brand new combination! The Series 2 NFTs are the key to unlocking our mobile app.

Our Series 1 public mint started on 6/15 at 5pm UTC (1pm ET/10am PST) and _SOLD OUT ON THE MORNING OF SATURDAY JULY 9TH_. We will never mint any more Wild Tangz Series 1. The mint price was 30₳ and the policy was set to expire on November 17, 2022 UTC (slot 77081375).

**How Many?**

Series 2 has a 1:1 upgrade for all 4,444 Series 1 Wild Tangz. In addition, there is the ability for an additional 4,444 new random pulls to be drawn from the mint.

Our Series 1 launch contained only 4,444 unique Wild Tangz. Several of those will be custom 1-of-1s drawn for team members and early supporters.&#x20;

**Can I Sell Them?**

Secondary listings can be placed or purchased on [JPG.store](https://www.jpg.store/) for Series 1 and 2 where our projects are verified. Please be aware that the prices of NFTs are extremely volatile and fluctuations in the prices of other NFTs and impact the price of your Wild Tangz both positively and negatively.  _NFTs such as Wild Tangz ARE NOT investments_. You assume all risks in that connection.

**Where Discord? Where Twitter?**

Come engage with us on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wildtangz) and Discord (you're here!) sites. We love feedback!

**In all honesty, what else do I need to know?**

We’ll be as transparent as we can and always strive to build an open, positive community! We are not having any special deals on mint price for anyone. We will mint \~1% of all Tangz for giveaways and team members.
